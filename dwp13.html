<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">The locomotive is a Weaver 2-<wbr>8-<wbr>0 converted to represent DWP # 1984, a Schenectady
    Consolidation. Key appearance changes include: boiler top check valve and new piping,
    bell move to front of boiler, new handrails, (loco and tender), shroud around the
    whistle, new coal bunker, new crew figures from Artista, paint, my own Alps printed
    decals and light weathering. </span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">The loco has a MDC large scale DCC decoder with steam sound. It carries two speakers;
    a big one in the tender and a smaller one facing up to the open stack. &nbsp;I’m pleased
    with the MDC decoder; the sound is good and there are plenty of bells and whistles
    to choose from. There are also a number of chuffs, chuff rates and other effects
    to program. The board is a bit large, but in this case it fits in the boiler. It
    is also reasonably priced when compared to some of the more sophisticated decoder
    such as QSI. The locomotive runs quite well and as yet is not really broken-<wbr>in.</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Photos from the era being modeled; mid-<wbr>1950&#39;s, show the loco to be relatively clean
    with a shiny boiler jacket, heavily sooted smoke box and obvious backwash down the
    sides of the boiler in front of the cab from the generator and auxiliary dome. I
    tried to replicate this look as seen in the photo below. I used a semi-<wbr>gloss finish
    instead of gloss to avoid a toy-<wbr>like finish. </span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">While not a perfect replica of the prototype, I believe it looks the part.</span></p>

<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">In 1948 the DWP replaced it’s old wooden coaling tower at West Duluth with this new
    pre-<wbr>fabricated coaling plant. I have not found out for certain the makers of these
    towers, but some say Fairbanks-<wbr>Morse was the manufacturer. Research indicates that
    these plants utilized the Redler “en-<wbr>mass” conveyor/elevator system to move coal
    from the dump to the steel bin. The Redler system was invented in the 1920’s and
    the company is still in buisness, <a href="http://www.redler.com/en/aboutus/the-en-masse-principal/"  target="_blank" title="Scale Art Parts O">http://www.redler.com/en/aboutus/the-<wbr>en-<wbr>masse-<wbr>principal/</a>
    The Canadians called these “Redler 50 ton Coal plants. It is possible that Fairbanks-<wbr>Morse
    manufactured the tower while employing the Redler system for coal handling. These
    plant seem to have been more common on Canadian roads than on US railroads, but as
    the PEG was Canadian National owned it makes sense that this type of coaling plant
    would appear on the DWP. &nbsp;Any photos I’ve found show hoppers spotted over the coal
    dump. A similar tower was located at the West Virginia yard as well.</span></p>

<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">The first step in making a model of this structure was to draw a scale plan, interpreting
    what was seen in the various photos. By studying the photos most of the key features
    can be discerned. &nbsp;Determining the size requires finding an object where the size
    is known or can be fairly assumed. In the case of this model there was a man standing
    on the tender which gave some relative scaling. Mostly the scaling of individual
    features is “educated” guess work. The tilt of the can was unknown, but study of
    the photos gave an angle that looked right. I think the final drawing is pretty close
    and most important has the character and feel of the prototype.</span></p>

<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">My model was constructed from mostly basic scratch-<wbr>building materials: strip and
    sheet styrene, plaststruct structural shapes, (mostly angle) &amp; model plywood for
    the base. I used a section of acrylic tube for the can. Its expensive stuff, about
    $20.00/foot. The acrylic tube was cut to length then chucked on a lathe. Three channels
    were cut into the tube for the welds/seams which you can see as white bands in the
    photo. The ends were made by cementing sheet styrene to the ends of the tube then
    cutting and sanding the ends to size once the cement had cured. </span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">The tricky part was setting the angle of the can. Once the angle was determined the
    Plastruct ABS angle was cut. The support was built up before cementing the can in
    place. All the bracing is Plastruct angle.</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">The chute and chute supports were built up from styrene. Originally it was planned
    to allow the chute to pivot, but as there were no clear photos of the coal door or
    release mechanism I decided the fix it in place. The upper level platform was another
    screwy thing to build due to the tilt of the can. It was built up from Plastruct
    angle and styrene plus one of my electric motor castings. The conveyor and ladder
    on the back of the unit are styrene and Plastruct.</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">The base is built from model aircraft plywood and some Plastruct I beams to carry
    the rails over the coal dump. The track is a section of Atlas flex with the ties
    removed over the pit. A hole the size of the pit will be cut out of the yard and
    the unit will slide down into place in alignment with the existing yard tracks. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Looking at the coal dump: I decided to put a kind of “Grizzly”in place. To those
    unfamiliar with the term it is used in mining and milling to prevent over large material
    from passing through. In this case the thought was to prevent careless personnel
    from falling into the dump. The grizzly is made from code 80 rail. I don’t know if
    this is common practice, but it made sense to me. Once in place, the code 148 Atlas
    track should line up perfectly with the track already laid in the yard. More on that
    after we get on site.</span></p>

<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">A close up of the styrene chute. Small brass eyebolts were formed for the lines that
    attach to the chute. As near as I can tell; the chute is first pulled down by a line
    that attaches the the flap in the front. This brings two other lines into reach which
    when pulled, draw down the long levers which open the coal door. The chute is also
    counter-<wbr>weighted.</span></p>

<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Two views of the upper platform show the bits that went into making the top of the
    coal conveyor. Here again there were no clear photos. The motor is my own resin piece
    as is the belt drive guard on the side. The railing is made of Plastruct angle. I
    don’t know what the “thing” is below the platform, but it can be seen in photos so
    there it is.</span></p>

<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">What a difference a little paint makes! A few Tichy lamps were added along with the
    ropes to dump the coal. The entire structure was primed with gray auto primer. This
    was followed with various layers of black. The black layers ranged from a very dark
    gray to very dark black. The tower was lightly streaked with rust and light gray.
    Overall it is intended to like like something that is perpetually coated in a fine
    layer of coal dust. </span></p>

<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">To improve the performance of the Weaver loco the tender was converted for power
    pick up. All four axles pick up juice and send it to the DCC decoder in the loco.
    The blackening was removed from the wheel backs and treads. Phosphor bronze wire
    was bent to shape and soldered to small pads of circuit board material. The circuit
    board pieces are epoxied to the trucks with some heavy paper insulation. The original
    Weaver harness is used to conduct the power to the loco and for the speaker hook
    up as well. The locomotive’s performance is greatly improved, particularly over the
    #7.5 Atlas switches.</span></p>
