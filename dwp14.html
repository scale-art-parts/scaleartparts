<p class="Normal-P0"><span class="Normal-C1">March 19 2012: It has been 35 months since we screwed the first pieces of wood together
    for this project. The progress has been consistent with only an occasional delay
    or reversal to make a change. The &nbsp;layout is really beginning to take on a personality
    now that more scenery is being added. The Easy DCC system has proven to be reliable
    even after several months of being idle. &nbsp;The layout has stabilized and we see no
    new shifting of the track due to expansion and contraction of the roadbed. This spring
    will see many new element added to the layout as scenery proceeds and new hardshell
    is laid in place. We will be making a few changes to some areas such as: additional
    track and rerouting some track for the Richeleau Taconite plant, added track for
    a paper mill at Ft. Francis and a couple of freight/warehouse tracks in front of
    the Duluth depot. &nbsp;We also are redoing the backdrop/fascia in the reverse loop East
    of Duluth and at the tunnel on Elys Peak. We have also decided to re-<wbr>hardshell Elys
    peak in plaster cloth and use plaster rock castings. &nbsp;We find the expanded foam hardshell
    to be fast and very suitable for rolling hills and flats, but are not too happy with
    using it for rocky mountainsides and our experimentation with the cast resin rock
    faces have been disappointing. So, make to the materials we know and love, good old
    plaster. </span></p>
<p class="Normal-P0"><span class="Normal-C1">Many structures remain to be built, both kit and scratch-<wbr>built. There are also many
    pre-<wbr>made structures stockpiled such as MTH, Lionel, Woodland Scenics and others,
    but all of them need some attention before they get placed. We still need thousands
    of trees, both conifer and deciduous types. Locomotives require DCC installs and
    cosmetic changes. We have lots to do and I will continue to chronicle as much as
    possible as we progress. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="Normal-P0"><span class="Normal-C1">Noah and I had a great first on-<wbr>site work session of 2012. After a couple of hours
    of regaining our bearings and organizing the tools and materials we dove right into
    the work at hand. Noah started making and placing sheets of expanded foam hard shell
    to fill open areas along the South wall. Scott went to work on the rural scene on
    the end of the second peninsula leading into Virginia. The work began by installing
    a pair of Tomar crossing signals and wiring them to detection, sound and light circuits
    from Azatrax, <a href="http://www.azatrax.com/"  target="_blank" title="azatraxlink">http://www.azatrax.com/ </a>. &nbsp;Azatrax uses an infrared detection system
    that works very well. Note in the photo; the brake lights on the Ford waiting at
    the xing. There is a location on the control board that provides a simple on for
    such things as a tip light on a crossing gate. I decided to use it to illuminate
    two red LEDs that I installed in the read fender of the model car. I think its pretty
    cool. The roadway surface is the foam core from “FOAMCORE board” with the paper removed.
    It is painted with acrylics after being glued to the layout. We had a camera malfunction
    so I did not get as many shots of the various processes and elements as I wanted.
    I will get into more detail on the Xing electronics and the scene, including the
    roadway in a near future posting. We took some photos with cell phone, but the quality
    is lacking, so check back in a few weeks for more.</span></p>

    box. I have yet to disguise the infrared LED across the track from here. &nbsp;Note the
    use of cinders as well as the mainline ballast mix. The mainline ballast is a mix
    of Buff, Gray and Iron Ore medium ballast from Woodland Scenics. This is a crushed
    walnut shell material which is light weight and tends to float if too much wet water
    or ballast cement is poured on. We are making our own ballast cement by mixing about
    &nbsp;1 part white glue to 8-<wbr>10 parts water with 6-<wbr>8 drops of Dawn dishwashing detergent
    added to help it flow. We first wet the ballast with “wet water” water with a few
    drops of dishwashing detergent added. The glue is dribbled down the center of the
    track and allowed to wick through to the shoulder.</span></p>

    the Plasticville structures, Woodland Scenics Hobo figures and lots of tress and
    underbrush. </span></p>

<p class="Normal-P0"><span class="Normal-C1">For Scott the big addition to the layout is the “Redler” coaling plant. Refer to
    page 13 and you can see the tower and base were built on the workbench. First the
    base needed to be set into the tabletop. It was carefully lined up with the existing
    yard tracks. The rail was cut and the ties removed. The cork and ballast were then
    scraped away to allow the “outriggers” to sit flush on the tabletop and the area
    for the dump was outline to be cut away.</span></p>

<p class="Normal-P0"><span class="Normal-C1">Three phone pics of the tower in place and a loco in for some service. The sand tower
    is not correct for the steam &nbsp;era, but a similar one was erected in 1957 with the
    coming of the RS-<wbr>11’s. It was provided by Jeff MacDonald. It looks nice, so we’re
    using it. There is another like it for West Virginia. I need to add a sand bin and
    numerous yard buildings. We’ve begun adding dirt, grass and other ground covers to
    the basic cinder ballast. Photos show an overgrown yard in the 50’s. The track was
    cleaned and we had a mini operating session. The rolling stock in the photos were
    scattered around the layout so using Loco 1984 the cars were rounded up, brought
    to West Duluth and sorted. It was a fun exercise and help to pin point areas of the
    track that needed attention. Many of the switches needed a good cleaning after all
    the ballasting. &nbsp;The loco, 1984 is described on page 13. Using the sound functions
    whistle signals were given during maneuvers. Sound really adds a whole new dimension
    to model railroading. Moving the Weaver 2-<wbr>8-<wbr>0 that has no sound was just not as much
    fun! I brought it back to the shop for sound installation. </span></p>
