<p class="Body-P0"><span class="Body-C0">This group represents the drums that are in better condition than the rest. Once
    the castings were cleaned up, washed and primed with automotive Gray primer, they
    were given a spray coat of ruddy brown or oxide red. This was allowed to dry then
    Bragdon rust color powders were applied then sealed with clear. The blue and wine
    color drums were then painted their final colors; the orange drum was treated differantly......

<p class="Body-P0"><span class="Body-C0">To achieve the nasty rusted look of the more battered drums they were prepared as
    above, but before painting the final color the drums had a coat of a craft store
    product called “Weathered Wood” brushed on. This is a clear gel-<wbr>like medium that
    creates a resist to further color coats and causes it to crackle or alligator. Once
    the weathered wood dried, several various shades of orange were airbrushed onto the
    drums and allowed to dry for only a few minutes to half an hour. Using a stiff brush
    and plain water the finish on the drums was attacked, the weathered wood being soluble
    allowed the rusty undercoat to show through. The final steps are to work the rusty
    areas with a little more rust powder, some dry brushing and a final clear coat to
    seal everything up.</span></p>

<p class="Body-P0"><span class="Body-C0">This was a fun project. Weathering is a creative endeavor that gives a model that
    realistic touch. We always look forward to doing projects like this for our customers
    so we hope you will consider some weathered drums for your railroad. We used 1 set
    of FA16-<wbr>55 gallon drums and one set of FA26-<wbr>Damaged drum. We substituted one upright
    damaged drum for the laying down drum that is normally included in FA26. &nbsp;</span></p>
