<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Body-C">One of Scale Art Models most memorable projects was the 4000 Sq. Ft. DWP. A 2 rail
    O Scale layout built for a client in Lincoln Nebraska. Scale Art Models did not enjoy
    the satisfaction of completing, 100% of the layout. Due to several issues and circumstances
    the client suspended our involvement before the project was officially completed.
    My sons and I worked on the project for 5+ years. A number of structures are built
    from scratch and many scenes are close to prototype. It was an enormous undertaking.
    This project nearly did me in, note the white hair and beard, was not so when I started.
    &nbsp;We commuted from Denver Colorado to work on the layout. We would stay in Lincoln
    for 7-<wbr>10 days at a time, generally twice a month through the spring, summer and early
    fall. We did not travel in the winter. The days we were at the site were intense,
    long days to get as much done as possible. We seldom saw the owner during our trips.
    He did not enjoy the process of building the layout. Some trips he would visit the
    site once, some not at all and we would see him only during our wrap up dinner before
    we left to go home. Sometimes he would hand me a list of changes for next trip. He
    was always thinking. We parted on good terms and he continued to send me modeling
    projects, mostly locomotives and rolling stock for conversions, repaints, etc. </span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Body-C">After we left the project the owner found some local railroaders through and including
    Randy’s Roundhouse in Lincoln who were willing to finish what we nearly finished.
    There are two youTube videos posted by the new group. The owner has since passed
    away. The video posters claim the owner never saw the layout operate, I don’t know
    if they mean “run” or as a formal operating session. He enjoyed watching it run on
    several occasions. Since his visits to the layout location were infrequent, he did
    not see it run as much as he could have. He was even offered a throttle to run the
    trains himself, but refused, he preferred to watch. It bothers me &nbsp;if the implication
    is that the owner never saw it run. It sullies some great moments we had with the
    owner and seems to put my competence in question. If the intent is that he never
    enjoyed an operating session all is cool on my end.</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Body-C">I have mixed emotions around the new folks being in there. On one hand, I’m very
    glad it is being operated and enjoyed, on the other I guess I’m a little envious
    and defensive about my work, my art that is now being exploited by others. &nbsp;They
    make no mention of my involvement in the project which I feel is a slight, those
    who know recognize the gargantuan effort and high quality work we put forth.</span></p>

    back in 1993. It was purchased from Caboose by a customer and underwent a complete

    in the photo. It has a NCE DCC system which was installed during the refurbish. It’s
    certainly one of a kind and was enjoyed by literally thousands of people, young and
