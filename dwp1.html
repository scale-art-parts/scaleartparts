<p class="Normal-P0"><span class="Normal-C1">For the past 2 ½ years we have been building a nearly 4000 square foot layout. We
    are working with a small crew; numbering 4 people at most and often only two on the
    job site. This is truly a labor of love for all involved. We are building this layout
    as if it is in our own basement, with great attention to detail and deliberate planning
    and model work. This is not a “run of the mill” contract job. The final railroad
    will be a fine example of 2 rail O scale modeling that reflects both the owners’
    and my own vision. </span></p>

    re-<wbr>powered with a drive from P&amp;D Hobbies and has a QSI sound decoder installed. So
    far it has been a fairly reliable loco though a little light. Extra weight has been
    added to make it a little more sure-<wbr>footed.</span></p>

<p class="Normal-P0"><span class="Normal-C4">The following photo journal is hoped to be an entertaining and informative document.
    This project is one of our current and certainly largest projects. We hope that some
    of the techniques and strategies employed in the construction of this &nbsp;layout will
    be useful to other modelers. Please do not attempt to locate or contact the clients
    involved. Any questions or comments may be directed to Scott Anderson, <a href="mailto:sanderson@scaleartmodels.com" title="scottemail">sanderson@scaleartmodels.com</a>.
    The layout is not </span><span class="Normal-C5">presently</span><span class="Normal-C4"> available for visitation. Open houses and other events
    will be announced when the layout is deemed to be in a suitable condition to host
    such events for the public and our fellow enthusiasts. &nbsp;Thank you for your consideration
    and interest.</span></p>

<p class="Normal-P0"><span class="Normal-C1"> The DWP or “PEG” is a 170 mile line that travels through some fantastic scenery
    from Duluth Minnesota to Ft. Francis, Ontario with connections to Winnipeg. The railroad
    dates back to the late 1800’s and is still in operation today. The DWP is a subsidiary
    of the Canadian National so the equipment and operating procedures bear a striking
    resemblance to the CN. We will be modeling 1956, steam was still the primary form
    of motive power, but diesel power will take over soon as 11 Alco RS11s will replace
    all steam within a year. Steam locos on the PEG were all 2-<wbr>8-<wbr>0’s built by Schenectady
    and Brooks. There were some visiting power from the Grand Trunk Western and &nbsp;Canadian
    National as well as connections with Great Northern, Chicago and Northwestern, SOO
    Line, Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range and Burlington; to name a few. Our layout is
    a very compressed version of the entire route originating at Duluth, Minnesota and
    terminating at Ft. Francis, Ontario. Major industries found along the line are paper
    and iron ore. While the DWP did not carry ore, it did interchange with the Missabe
    near the town of Virginia, Minnesota. Much of the scenery is rural which means thousands
    of trees, however there are two large urban areas; Duluth/West Duluth and Virginia.
    Operations consists primarily of freights; pulpwood north to Ontario and paper goods
    south back to Duluth. Passenger trains ran once or twice a day. &nbsp;Train orders were
    passed to stations by telegraph well into the 1970’s. There is no signaling. When
    finished the layout will require 8 operators, but one person can run the layout,
    sit back and enjoy the trains as they pass trough a miniature Minnesota landscape.</span></p>

<p class="Normal-P0"><span class="Normal-C1">The plan above shows the overall size and shape of the layout as well as some of
    the major points. The building is approximately 100’ x 59’. The lowest tracks are
    42” at Duluth and they climb to 62” crossing over the aisle in the lower left corner.
    There is nearly 3000’ feet of Atlas Flex track and 150 plus Atlas turnouts involved.
    Each yard can hold upwards of 150 cars. There are 3 six stall roundhouses and 3 turntables.
    Many of the structures are unique and will be scratch-<wbr>built. Many or the depots are
    built to Canadian National standard designs. There is one tunnel on the line located
    at Ely’s Peak just North of West Duluth. There are numerous bridges. The layout is
    loop to loop. Each reverse loop is automatic using CVP Products auto reversing boosters.
    The railroad is DCC using CVP Product’s Easy DCC system. There are 12 power zones.
    Control is by wireless hand-<wbr>held throttles . There are two 24”Millhouse River turntables
    and one 36” Bowser turntable. The mainline minimum radius is 60” and the steepest
    grade is 1.5%. Most of the switches use Caboose Industries ground throws, there are
    some Tortoise switch machines used as well. Benchwork is L girder. Wiring is 12 gauge
    stranded for the buss and 18 gauge stranded for the feeders. The roadbed is Midwest
    cork on 3/4” plywood sub-<wbr>roadbed. Scenery is expanded urethane hardshell over foamboard
    formers. &nbsp;Many of the structures will be scratch-<wbr>built &nbsp;while kits and ready-<wbr>built
    will be used where a specific prototype is not required. The majority of the steam
    locos are re-<wbr>detailed Weaver 2-<wbr>8-<wbr>0 Consolidations. The RS-<wbr>11s are also Weaver. As
    decoders and details are added to the locos I will add segments to this journal as
    to how and what is done. </span></p>

<p class="Normal-P0"><span class="Normal-C3">To the right is an un-<wbr>modified, except for a MRC decoder, Weaver 2-<wbr>8-<wbr>0. While the
    manufacturer &nbsp;intends them to be Baldwin products, they have a fairly generic look
    that will pass as the Brooks and Schenectady locos used by the DWP. The details of
    the DWP locos are very “Canadian National”. The loco in the photo has been running
    on the layout for about a year. It is reasonably reliable although we added more
    pickups to the loco and converted the tender to pickup track power as well. Look
    for more info on these changes and more as this journal progresses. </span></p>
